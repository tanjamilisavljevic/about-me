  <h5 class="story-title"> A funny story</h5>
  <p class="storyp"> My dog was in a foster home before I adopted her. When I went to pick her up, she was
    the only dog in the room to get up and approach me. We went for a walk and then I got to take her home.
    After a few months, she had to go to the vet for the first time. This was also the first time ever I looked
    into her passport. I was super suprised to see we have the same birthday! I feel like it was meant to be!
